# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive frontend authentication and user onboarding flow for the Griot manga platform. The system will provide a seamless user experience from initial landing page through authentication, preferences collection, and access to the main dashboard for manga generation. The frontend will integrate with AWS Cognito for authentication and the existing API for user preferences and manga generation functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new visitor, I want to see an attractive landing page with clear signup and login options, so that I can easily understand the platform and begin the registration process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the root URL THEN the system SHALL display a landing page with platform branding and description
2. WHEN a user views the landing page THEN the system SHALL display prominent "Sign Up" and "Login" buttons
3. WHEN a user clicks "Sign Up" or "Login" THEN the system SHALL redirect to the Cognito Managed UI with appropriate parameters
4. WHEN the landing page loads THEN the system SHALL display key features and benefits of the manga platform
5. WHEN the page is viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive design that works across all screen sizes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate through Cognito Managed UI and be automatically redirected back to the application, so that I can securely access the platform without managing complex authentication flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes authentication in Cognito Managed UI THEN the system SHALL redirect to the configured callback URL with an authorization code
2. WHEN the callback URL receives an authorization code THEN the system SHALL exchange it for ID, Access, and Refresh tokens
3. WHEN tokens are successfully obtained THEN the system SHALL store them securely in the browser
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and redirect to login
5. WHEN tokens are stored THEN the system SHALL redirect authenticated users to the appropriate next step in the flow

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want my tokens to be automatically refreshed when they expire, so that I can continue using the platform without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ID or Access tokens expire (after 1 hour) THEN the system SHALL automatically use the refresh token to obtain new tokens
2. WHEN the refresh token is valid THEN the system SHALL update stored tokens with new ID and Access tokens
3. WHEN the refresh token expires (after 30 days) THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to login
4. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL clear stored tokens and redirect to login
5. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL include valid Access tokens in Authorization headers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a newly registered user, I want to provide my manga preferences through an intuitive form, so that the platform can generate personalized content for me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user completes authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect to a preferences collection page
2. WHEN the preferences page loads THEN the system SHALL display a form with relevant manga preference options
3. WHEN a user submits preferences THEN the system SHALL make a POST request to the /preferences API endpoint
4. WHEN preferences are successfully saved THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the dashboard
5. WHEN preferences submission fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages and allow retry
6. WHEN returning users authenticate THEN the system SHALL skip preferences collection and go directly to dashboard

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an authenticated user with saved preferences, I want to access a dashboard where I can generate manga stories, so that I can create personalized content based on different categories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user with preferences accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display manga generation options
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL show different manga categories for story generation
3. WHEN a user selects a category and initiates generation THEN the system SHALL make appropriate API calls to generate manga content
4. WHEN manga generation is in progress THEN the system SHALL display loading states and progress indicators
5. WHEN manga generation completes THEN the system SHALL display the generated content to the user
6. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages with retry options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle authentication state consistently across all pages, so that I have a seamless experience regardless of how I navigate the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to any protected route without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login flow
2. WHEN an authenticated user navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain their authentication state
3. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL restore their authentication state from stored tokens
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all stored tokens and redirect to the landing page
5. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the current state across all components
