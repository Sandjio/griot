# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a serverless event-driven manga generation platform that creates personalized manga content based on user preferences. The system leverages AWS services including API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, EventBridge, Bedrock, and S3 to provide a scalable, production-ready solution. The platform integrates with the Qloo API for user preference insights and uses AI models for story and image generation.

## Requirements

5. WHEN episode is saved THEN the system SHALL store episode reference and metadata in DynamoDB
6. WHEN episode metadata is stored THEN the system SHALL publish an event to EventBridge for image generation
7. IF episode generation fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and maintain story state

### Requirement 5: Image Generation and PDF Creation

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual manga content with generated images, so that I can enjoy a complete manga reading experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image generation event is received THEN the system SHALL trigger the image generation Lambda function
2. WHEN image generation starts THEN the system SHALL fetch episode content from S3
3. WHEN episode content is retrieved THEN the system SHALL prompt Bedrock image generation model
4. WHEN images are generated THEN the system SHALL create a PDF file combining images and text
5. WHEN PDF is created THEN the system SHALL save the PDF to S3
6. WHEN PDF is saved THEN the system SHALL store PDF reference and metadata in DynamoDB
7. IF image generation fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and provide fallback content

### Requirement 6: API Design and REST Endpoints

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want well-defined REST API endpoints, so that I can integrate with the manga generation platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API Gateway is configured THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful endpoints for all operations
2. WHEN endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL validate authentication using Cognito
3. WHEN preference submission endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL accept and validate preference data
4. WHEN story retrieval endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return user's generated content
5. WHEN status endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return generation progress information
6. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized response

### Requirement 6A: Batch Manga Generation Workflow API

**User Story:** As a user, I want to start a manga generation workflow that creates multiple stories in batches, so that I can generate several stories sequentially rather than simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to /workflow/start THEN the system SHALL accept a parameter specifying the number of stories to generate
2. WHEN the workflow starts THEN the system SHALL query user preferences from DynamoDB to use for story generation
3. WHEN generating multiple stories THEN the system SHALL process them sequentially (one at a time) not simultaneously
4. WHEN each story is completed THEN the system SHALL generate the first episode and corresponding images before proceeding to the next story
5. WHEN the workflow is running THEN the system SHALL provide status updates via the /status endpoint
6. IF the workflow fails on one story THEN the system SHALL continue with the remaining stories and report the failure

### Requirement 6B: Continue Episode Generation API

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate additional episodes for existing manga stories, so that I can extend stories that I like.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to /stories/{storyId}/episodes THEN the system SHALL generate the next episode for that story
2. WHEN generating a new episode THEN the system SHALL determine the next episode number automatically
3. WHEN episode generation starts THEN the system SHALL use the original story content and user preferences
4. WHEN the new episode is completed THEN the system SHALL generate corresponding images and create a PDF

### Requirement 8: Event-Driven Architecture and Reliability

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want reliable event-driven processing, so that the system can handle failures gracefully and maintain data consistency.
